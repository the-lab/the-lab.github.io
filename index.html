  Happy Birthday Karen!!  I hope you have the best day ever!!  This website was developed by me and an Internet friend. Hope you like it!! It’s mainly focused on chemistry because I know you love chemistry. Remember what we talked in class
  <br><br>
  i. Chemistry<br>
  ii. Physics<br>
  iii. Biology
  </p>

  Hope you have a good experience with this project. To be honest, we ran late so we had to delete some features and make some features less cool. Anyways the features that we had to remove are coming in new versions. I’ll take a guess and assume you are checking this site on your mother’s phone and 100% sure your mother is reading this with you so I can’t use bad language LOL :P kidding by the way Hi Miss Rola. Anyways I hope you have a great experience and  have the best birthday!!
